## Previous Attempt Summary

{{ copilot_summary }}

## Issues Found

{% for category, findings in findings_by_category.items() %}
### {{ category|upper }} Issues

{% for finding in findings %}
**{{ finding.severity|upper }}: {{ finding.title }}**

*Description:* {{ finding.description }}

*Evidence:*
```
{{ finding.evidence }}
```

*Suggested Fix:* {{ finding.suggested_fix }}

{% endfor %}

{% if failed_checklist_items %}
## Failed Acceptance Criteria

The following acceptance criteria from the original specification were not completed:

{% for item in failed_checklist_items %}
- [ ] {{ item }}
{% endfor %}

**These must be completed in this pass.**

{% endif %}

---

## Required Fixes

Based on the findings above, you must:

{% for fix in suggested_fixes %}
{{ loop.index }}. {{ fix }}
{% endfor %}

---

## Suggested Approach

1. **Review the evidence** for each finding to understand what went wrong
2. **Address critical issues first** (major findings) before moving to medium and minor issues
3. **Complete failed acceptance criteria** that were identified in the checklist
4. **Validate your changes** by running the same checks that failed previously
5. **Ensure no regressions** - don't break things that were working

---

## Important Notes

- All original requirements from the specification still apply
- Focus on fixing the identified issues without introducing new problems
- Test your changes thoroughly before completing this pass
- If any requirement is unclear, make reasonable assumptions and document them
